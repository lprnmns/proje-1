5. Set leverage for MARGIN instruments under cross-margin trade mode and Portfolio margin at currency level.
6. Set leverage for FUTURES instruments under cross-margin trade mode at underlying level.
7. Set leverage for FUTURES instruments under isolated-margin trade mode and buy/sell position mode at contract level.
8. Set leverage for FUTURES instruments under isolated-margin trade mode and long/short position mode at contract and position side level.

Set MMP
This endpoint is used to set MMP configure

Only applicable to Option in Portfolio Margin mode, and MMP privilege is required.


What is MMP?
Market Maker Protection (MMP) is an automated mechanism for market makers to pull their quotes when their executions exceed a certain threshold(`qtyLimit`) within a certain time frame(`timeInterval`). Once mmp is triggered, any pre-existing mmp pending orders(`mmp` and `mmp_and_post_only` orders) will be automatically canceled, and new orders tagged as MMP will be rejected for a specific duration(`frozenInterval`), or until manual reset by makers.

How to enable MMP?
Please send an email to institutional@okx.com or contact your business development (BD) manager to apply for MMP. The initial threshold will be upon your request.

Things to note
Only applicable to users with a trading level greater than or equal to VIP6, and can only be called through the API Key of the master account.
The source and destination accounts for move positions must be accounts under the same master account and they must be different.
For source account, a maximum of fifteen move position requests can be triggered within a 24-hour period. There is no limitation to the destination account to receive positions. Only successful requests are counted toward this limit.
The maximum number of legs per move position request is 30.
No move position fee will be charged at this time.
Moving positions is not supported in margin trading now.
The move position price is determined by the TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) of the mark price over the past 60 minutes, using the closing mark price per minute. If the symbol is newly listed and a 60-minute TWAP is unavailable, the move position will be rejected with error code 70065
The move position will share the same price limit as those in the order book. The move position will fail if the 60-minute mark price TWAP is outside of the price limit.
For the source account, move positions must be conducted in a reduce-only manner. You must choose the opposite side of your current position and specify a size equal to or smaller than your existing position size. The system will also process move position requests in a best-effort reduce-only manner.
The side field of source account leg (from) should be sell if you are holding a long position while the side of destination account leg (to) should be buy, vice versa for a short position.
The posSide field of destination account (to) should be net if it's in one-way mode; long/short if it's in hedge mode. If in hedge mode, you need to specify long/short to decide whether to close current positions or open reverse positions. Otherwise, it will always open new positions.
Open long: buy and open long (side: buy; posSide: long)
Open short: sell and open short (side: sell; posSide: short)
Close long: sell and close long (side: sell; posSide: long)
Close short: buy and close short (side: buy; posSide: short)
Historical records of move positions can be fetched from the Get move positions history endpoint but only for pending or successful requests.
Move positions operation counting example.
Transfer done within the day	Account A count (total)	Account B count (total)	Account C count (total)	Account D count (total)
Account A to Account B	1	0	0	0
Account B to Account C	1	1	0	0
